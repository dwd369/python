#Exercise 1.2
## Goal of the exercise is to append multiple recipes into a single list
## Reason I choose dictionary as individual recipe is because it allows the user to fetch the recipe's name, cook, time, or ingredient individually when needed
## Reason I choose list as all_recipe is because it's convenience to fetch a specific item using index number, providing the ability to loop through each item to find a specific recipe
